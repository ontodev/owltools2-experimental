# Missing Superclass

**Problem:** A class does not have a superclass. This is not relevant for top-level classes, but may reveal orphaned children. Excludes deprecated entities.

**Solution:** Make sure there are no orphaned children - if so, assert a parent.

```sparql
PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?entity ?property ?value WHERE {
 VALUES ?property { rdfs:subClassOf }
 ?entity a owl:Class .
 FILTER (!isBlank(?entity)) .
 FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?entity ?property ?value }
 FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?entity owl:deprecated true }
}
ORDER BY ?entity
```
